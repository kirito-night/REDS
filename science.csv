The funny thing is, I was thinking about this point just last week. The angles of any triangle must add to 180¬∞. So the space of all possible triangles (up to similarity), is given by a ternary plot ( https:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_ plot ). The triangle corresponding to a point in the plot has angles given by the distances to each side of the plot. The isosceles triangles correspond to the points on the altitudes (red) since these are equally far from two sides. The right-angled triangles lie on the medial triangle (green) since 90¬∞ is half of 180¬∞. Acute triangles are within the medial triangle, obtuse triangles outside. Permuting the corners of the plot just permutes the vertices of the triangles, so all acute triangles are represented by some point in the blue triangle. Often in mathematics, when you want to optimise a distance it is instead better to look at the square of the distance. Things just work out nicer that way. So the symmedial point of the blue triangle is the one which is least like an isoceles or right-angled triangle. Behold the most scalene triangle! (Its angles are 45¬∞, 56.25¬∞ and 78.75¬∞) # Math # Maths # Mathematics","['#Mathober', '#Mathober2023', '#Math', '#Maths', '#Mathematics']",science

"I am offering this term BSc-thesis topics about ""activist research"" for grad students of environmental science at the university I teach. A definition of activist research: ""(1) combination of knowledge production and transformative action; (2) systematic multi-level collaboration; and (3) challenges to power. The most salient characteristic of activist research is the belief that it must go farther than knowledge production; it must create transformative action. Knowledge production is the epitome of all research, even for studies that seek to expose inequities and call out oppressive systems and structures, but activist research goes further by committing to bringing about change with and for the participants"" (1) I thought about having them organizing interviews with experts and workshops to strategize food system transformation like this one.ü•ï https:// undisciplinedenvironments.org/ 2023/09/28/a-workshop-for-strategizing-food-system-transformation-through-degrowth-thinking/ 2) Another one could cover emissions in a city by studying the most important polluters/polluting ativities. Then to investigate possibilities for action and identify the most efficient way to make pressure/achieve change (pushing the local administration, organizing a public campaign directed at a company, public education...). ‚úàÔ∏è 3) Another one (more urban planning-oriented): map all the roofs in the city and calculate the potential for solar panels (here are inclreasingly land use conflicts about new solar parks). Similar could be done about mobility, mapping traffic, urban space for cars and proposing a mobility transition. üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Life's too short and change is too urgent to produce boring scientific studies nobody really needs...

"We Don't Know Enough About the Biomedical Challenges of Deep Space Exploration Although humans have flown to space for decades, it's primarily been in low-Earth orbit, with just a handful of trips to the Moon. Future missions will hope to live, work on the Moon, and even send humans to Mars. However, the environment of deep space presents additional challenges over the low-Earth orbit, such as higher radiation, changes to the circadian rhythms, and additional acceleration and deceleration forces. A new paper proposes where the future of biomedicine in space. We'd better learn quickly since astronauts are headed to the Moon in just a few years. # spaceexploration https://www. universetoday.com/163469/we-do nt-know-enough-about-the-biomedical-challenges-of-deep-space-exploration/",['#spaceexploration'],science

"Brain Implant and Camera Glasses Restore Sight to Blind Woman A team of researchers has found a way to restore sight to the blind by combining a brain implant with a pair of camera glasses. As summarized in an article from The University of Utah , a team of researchers from the John A. Moran Eye Center at the University of Utah and Spain‚Äôs Miguel Hernandez University successfully created a form of artificial vision for a blind 58-year old biology teacher named Berna Gomez. When she was 42, Gomez developed toxic optical neuropathy, a severe disease that destroyed the optic nerves that connect her eyes to her brain. The illness left her blind. To try and give her back her vision -- at least to some degree -- the team applied what they describe as a ""visual prosthesis"" that combines a 4√ó4-millimeter electrode with a hundred micro-needles and attached it to the visual cortex of Gomez's brain. ""We implanted an intracortical microelectrode array consisting of 96 electrodes in the visual cortex of a 57-year-old person with complete blindness for a six-month period. We measured thresholds and the characteristics of the visual percepts elicited by intracortical microstimulation,"" the team explains. The implant, called the Moran | Cortivis prosthesis, is designed to bypass the eye and optic nerve and send signals directly to the center of visual perception in the brain, which was the focus of the researchers' attempts to restore Gomez's vision. After the implant was inserted into her brain, Gomez spent six months with the researchers in a lab where she underwent daily tests that allowed her to practice with her new implant. Over the course of that time, she learned to recognize spots of light and edges of objects that were fed to her as a direct stimulation from the prosthesis. According to the report that was published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation , the researchers found the process to be a rousing success. There were no complications with the implant process and they were able to consistently obtain high-quality recordings from the visually deprived neurons of her brain over time. J Clin Invest. 2021. During the last part of the study, the researchers combined the implant with special glasses with a built-in camera that scanned objects in front of Gomez and then stimulated the electrodes in her brain through the prosthesis, which enhanced her ability to ""see"" simple images. Gomez was then able to learn to see contrasting boundaries of black and white stripes on cardboard. < https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2021/11/151331-JCI-CMED-RV-3_sd_538313.mp4 > Based on the descriptions, what Gomez was experiencing was a completely new way of ""seeing"" that mimics how people with unimpaired eyesight perceive vision, but different since it has to bypass the normal optical pathways. This method requires training the brain to understand the signals that are being sent as sight over a period of time. The results of their study have led the researchers to believe they have made major developments in the field. ""We observed a learning process that helped the subject to recognize complex patterns over time,"" the team reports and says that they believe that they have proven that this method has a high potential for restoring functional vision in the blind.

And now courtesy of mismanagement by # spez , # Reddit , # AdvanceMedia , and the Reddit board, # GeneralWebSearch which as been in a death spiral for years is suddenly getting far, far worse.
