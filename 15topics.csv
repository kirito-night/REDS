They didnt talk about the part where Israel initially took responsibility for the attack then later removed its post. They then explained that they HAVE to destroy Al-Shifa hospital because Hamas DEFINITELY is there! So heres the official argument: ""We didn't destroy the hospital but definitely had to destroy the other hospital and the 35 hospitals in Operation Cast Led"".

Instead of it being explicit like in Rust or C++, Python tries to do the thing you probably, but not necessarily, want to do. All primitive types - bools, numbers, and strings are always passed by value into functions. That means that if you change them inside, that change won't affect the calling scope. Objects, arrays, dictionaries, and other non-primitive types are always passed by mutable reference, meaning that changes to them will affect the caller. Furthermore, copies of these objects are always shallow so changes to copies will also change the original. Luckily, there is a module that implements deep copy for you, at least for more common types. # python # programming # tips",#TuesdayCodingTips,#python,#programming,#tips,,jakub_neruda,2023-11-14 11:49:41+00:00

Yesterday while cooking we accidentally left an unlit stove burner on high for a few minutes and filled the upstairs with gas. I immediately evacuated the kids and walked through to open all the windows to air out the house. Everything was fine and the smell was gone in about twenty minutes. My weird question is this: Ever since then (about 18 hours) my farts have smelled exactly like that ""natural gas smell."" I know that methyl mercaptan is a natural bi-product of digestion so a bit is always there, but is it possible that the amount I inhaled into my lungs was processed into my bloodstream and added to what was already in my bowels in a meaningful (detectable) amount?

Science,Physics,"_The Evening Post_, 15 Nov 1923: WIRELESS TERRORS “TOO MUCH RUTHERFORD” LONDON, 18th September. For a full hour and a half one evening last week Sir Ernest Rutherford’s speech on the “Electrical Structure of Matter” at the British Association Congress was served up by wireless to all who possessed a set. The lecture was hardly intended for father, mother, and the whole family in every part of the Kingdom, and there seems to have been a mild protest from wireless enthusiasts over what they called “Too much Rutherford.“ The “Evening Standard” thus describes the “terrible affliction” and the reason for it.… [Mr. Burrows, Director of BBC programming:] “We did it because the British Association is the biggest thing of its kind. It is the most important scientific body we have. We wanted to demonstrate simultaneous broadcasting all over the country, and as this was an important scientific experiment we thought it would be good to link it up with an important scientific deliverance.”…  Mr. Burrows laughed, and said, “Oh, yes; I can certainly promise that. We have made our simultaneous transmission experiment, and subscribers need not expect to have a repetition of this kind of thing.” https:// paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/news papers/EP19231115.2.148 # OnThisDay # OTD # PapersPast # Science # Physics # Radio # Broadcasting",#OnThisDay,#OTD,#PapersPast,#Science,#Radio,JohnDA,2023-11-14 16:42:35+00:00

Science,Science,"_The Evening Post_, 15 Nov 1923: WIRELESS TERRORS “TOO MUCH RUTHERFORD” LONDON, 18th September. For a full hour and a half one evening last week Sir Ernest Rutherford’s speech on the “Electrical Structure of Matter” at the British Association Congress was served up by wireless to all who possessed a set. The lecture was hardly intended for father, mother, and the whole family in every part of the Kingdom, and there seems to have been a mild protest from wireless enthusiasts over what they called “Too much Rutherford.“ The “Evening Standard” thus describes the “terrible affliction” and the reason for it.… [Mr. Burrows, Director of BBC programming:] “We did it because the British Association is the biggest thing of its kind. It is the most important scientific body we have. We wanted to demonstrate simultaneous broadcasting all over the country, and as this was an important scientific experiment we thought it would be good to link it up with an important scientific deliverance.”…  Mr. Burrows laughed, and said, “Oh, yes; I can certainly promise that. We have made our simultaneous transmission experiment, and subscribers need not expect to have a repetition of this kind of thing.” https:// paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/news papers/EP19231115.2.148 # OnThisDay # OTD # PapersPast # Science # Physics # Radio # Broadcasting",#OnThisDay,#OTD,#PapersPast,#Physics,#Radio,JohnDA,2023-11-14 16:42:35+00:00

Science,Science,"Tom Murphy is a professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego. In the piece excerpted below, he presents a darkly humorous and rather grim exercise in attempting to quantify the economic value of bugs... _______________________________ I have pointed out before that humans now vastly outweigh wild mammals, to the point that we only have 2.5 kg of wild land mammal mass left per human on the planet. The trends are falling fast: insect, bird, mammal, amphibian, and fish populations are losing ground to the tune of 1–2% per year, amounting to halving populations over a handful of decades. Inevitably, then, extinctions are up a thousand-fold, and increasing. This is decidedly not good, and perhaps the most glaring sign that modernity is a literal dead-end path. The approach here is to assume that Earth’s ecology would crash without any arthropods (insects, spiders, centipedes, and crustaceans). The same might be said for fish, or birds, or any major group. Bugs (an informal catch-all substitute for arthropods here) are particularly attractive to me for this exercise because they are so crucial in terms of food for others, soil conditioning, pollination, and other services, that it is hard to believe other phyla could carry on without them. Evolution produces a complex interconnected web that cannot be expected to maintain its overall integrity if surgically plucked apart in this way — much as an organism cannot be expected to survive if completely removing any one of many key organs. Therefore, no bugs = no humans. No them, no us. Our economic regime is so narrowly imbecilic as to neglect the very thing that makes its own existence possible. It lacks context. By placing essentially zero (or even negative) value on bugs, it incentivizes its own destruction. It’s the metaphor of cutting off the branch you’re standing on: marvelous efficiency, but to an ultimately disastrous end. How could this short-sightedness happen? Because markets can generate short term gains (profits) without consideration of such elements — for centuries, even. That’s good enough for markets to function and grow to dominate life, complete with insufferable economists bossing us about how it works. But what are centuries against the 500 million years of evolution that gave the Earth its arthropod foundation — not to mention the billions of years that set the stage for even that step?  Apparently, that’s worth nothing, economically? Let’s be clear: the culture has it terribly wrong. Such an attitude can appear to work for a time, but the fate of the biophysical world is steady decline as one commodity after another is monetized, displacing the community of life and making various creatures’ existence progressively more difficult and dismal to the point of non-viability and extinction. Our culture might view this as unfortunate and unintended collateral damage, but not as an existential threat of our own making. What I am saying is that a system powerful enough to destroy ecological health and biodiversity — which we have demonstrated in spades — cannot survive unless it deliberately refrains from using this power. It must invert the cultural hierarchy and place ecosystem health — the vitality of the biodiverse planet — above ALL other considerations. _______________________________ FULL ESSAY -- https://www. resilience.org/stories/2023-11 -08/nothing-without-bugs/ # Science # Environment # Climate # ClimateChange # ClimateCrisis # Biodiversity",#Environment,#Climate,#ClimateChange,#ClimateCrisis,#Biodiversity,breadandcircuses,2023-11-14 14:00:10+00:00

Science,Science,"Human commerce, petrochemicals, industrialized agriculture, and rampant pollution are killing the biosphere. Our precious and life-sustaining ecosystem is being murdered by greedy capitalists and the craven politicians they own. ____________________________ Two million species are at risk of extinction, a figure that is double previous UN estimates, new analysis has found. While scientists have long documented the decline of species of plants and vertebrates, there has always been significant uncertainty over insects, with the UN making a “tentative estimate” of 10% threatened with extinction in 2019. Since then, more data has been collected on insects, showing the proportion at risk of extinction is much higher than previously estimated. Because there are so many insect species, this doubles the global number of species at risk, according to the paper. Understanding what is happening to global insect populations has been challenging because of the lack of data – but 97% of all animals are invertebrates. Of that group, about 90% are classified as insects. They provide vital ecosystem services: pollinating crops, recycling nutrients into soils, and decomposing waste. “Without insects, our planet will not be able to survive,” said Axel Hochkirch, from the Musée National d’Histoire Naturelle in Luxembourg. ____________________________ Two million species!!!

Entertainment,Theatre,"Conspiracies and miscommunications make for daft comedy and political satire. Photo: Dylan Elliott. UCL Students’ Union Drama Society is putting on a performance of Oscar Wilde’s An Ideal Husband at the Bloomsbury Theatre this week. Directed by Sophie Eaton and Jai Britto, they intend to “pull this classic period drama out of its usual mould with a production as flamboyant, novel, and politically biting as Wilde intended it”. Amidst the glamour and frivolity of high society centred on the Chiltern household, a series of scandals are exposed, forcing the characters to confront which of their ideals they are willing to sacrifice for love. Conspiracies and miscommunications make for daft comedy and political satire which show us that everything and nothing is as it seems. The Chilterns’ ideal marriage is threatened by a mysterious lady and a dodgy deal made eighteen years earlier. The plot thickens when it appears her past features both Chiltern and his best friend Goring whose precious career, not as a politician but as a bachelor, is also threatened when he is given 24 hours to find a wife. He finds much more, with a third Chiltern. UCL SU Drama presents: An Ideal Husband. 16, 17 and 18 November 2023. Bloomsbury Theatre, University College London, 15 Gordon Street, London, WC1H 0AH.

Entertainment,Theatre,"Thursday I went to see the play KILL THE RIPPER in downtown DC. Despite the dark subject matter, it's a fairly broad and bawdy comedy. Kit, Pudding, and newcomer Viola are three ladies of the evening who hang out on a particular Whitechapel street corner. They're fearful about the ongoing murders but still have to earn a living, so they discuss the situation and decide to arm themselves. All the male roles in the play are performed by a single actor: Viola's submissive client Percival; Charlie, the actor who Pudding is infatuated with; the mean local policeman; various passers-by and minor characters; and of course the Ripper himself. The play is funny and it's staged well, doing a lot with the tiny little black-box space. Here's a review from the local alt-weekly: https:// washingtoncitypaper.com/articl e/636325/kill-the-ripper-tells-an-edgy-tale-in-which-jack-the-rippers-targets-fight-back/ # theatre # JackTheRipper",#theatre,#JackTheRipper,,,,akuchling,2023-11-12 00:11:36+00:00

News,CitizenJournalism,"@ philip I'm curious about how the state determined the order in which level crossings in Victoria will be removed. Was it a simple model based on traffic volume at major intersections (e.g., Bell Street). Did it include time-of-day metrics? Commercial traffic versus private commuter vehicles? There has to be an Excel spreadsheet. My guess is that whatever method was used has been conveniently deemed ""commercial in confidence"" and we won't know. Even with an FoI request. Noting that ""Commercial in Confidence"" does not exist to protect proprietary professional methodologies, as we are told. Rather, it is an effective way to hide information that could be used in future litigation. # CitizenJournalism",,,,,,jmcleod,2023-07-10 22:58:04+00:00

News,CitizenJournalism,"Imagine an online space where you could go to not only receive the latest news about actions in your locality, but also share information about campaigns or events – without driving more traffic to the digital capitalists of Facebook and Twitter, who continue to ban anti-fascists. Those who recall # IndyMedia will not only be familiar with the concept, but also lament its lack of editorial oversight and eventual collapse under the weight of conspiracy theories and anti-Semitism that have no place in antifascist media. Last year, the # IWW celebrated writers at The Canary overthrowing management and becoming a workers’ co-operative. But even now, much like the # BylineTimes (a private company with directors), # TheCanary still faces a battle for online clicks within the commercial landscape. It’s useful to remember that the term “freedom of the press” did not originally mean the media marketplace, but literally the freedom to publish using a printing press: # CitizenJournalism , based on the spirit of # MutualAid . It is mutual aid that inspired the name of France’s # MutuNetwork that today has over a dozen regional websites in not just # France , but also # Switzerland and # Austria , reporting on striking workers, occupying students, and other local struggles, operated in a non-hierarchical but also non-commercial way – true citizen journalism, with a set of agreed standards. Several of us media activists have started to discuss how we could develop Local Autonomous Media (or # LoAM ) in the UK after hearing about the success of # Mutu . We’ve set up chat groups and even held Jitsi meetings online with Mutu contributors in Switzerland. And we’re looking to set in place the building blocks to create something similar in the UK.

News,CitizenJournalism,"# CitizenJournalism story of the week features a compelling mix of crimes against ecosystems.  These crimes are perpetuated by Chicago-based Exelon Corp and none other than PG&E, which itself is also precariously bankrupt. TL;DR Summary: Exelon Corp  is NOT a ""clean"" or ""renewable"" energy company; it is bankrupt and desperate to continue polluting.  As operator of the Conowingo Dam, it is actually dispersing ecosystem-killing pollutants into the already sick and weak Chesapeake Bay. ""The bay's hypoxic (low oxygen) and anoxic (no oxygen) zones are caused by excess nutrient pollution, primarily from agriculture and wastewater. The excess nutrients stimulate an overgrowth of algae, which then sinks and decomposes in the water. The resulting low oxygen levels are insufficient to support most marine life and habitats in near-bottom waters, threatening the bay's crabs, oysters and other fisheries. This summer's Chesapeake Bay hypoxic or ""dead zone,"" an area of low oxygen that can kill fish and other aquatic life, is expected to be about 2.1 cubic miles, while the volume of water with no oxygen is predicted to be between 0.49 and 0.63 cubic miles during early and late summer.""

Art and Culture,Culture,"“Our ancestors arrived more than 60,000 years ago. The world they created was destroyed in less than 250 years. Indigenous people were here first, long before the Anglo-Saxon peoples came into being. Our peoples could have been given an honourable place in this postcolonial nation. This could have been the unifying gesture by those who gained most from colonisation – descendants of the British settlers and the non-British who have come to enjoy the benefits of colonisation. Australians would not need to feel guilty or ashamed about the fact they live in a country that the British colonised in brutal warfare against our peoples. They could accept the plain fact that our ancestors were here first and acknowledge our existence in the Constitution. A line could have been drawn, ending the postcolonial politics of blame and guilt.” Marcia Langton on the end of reconciliation .   ",,,,,,alis,2023-11-14 14:36:02+00:00

The country’s national assembly approved a bill last month authorizing companies to test computer-vision cameras to use at stadiums and nearby transportation hubs to identify security threats during the Olympics. The law, which will likely be enacted in the coming months, would allow the cameras to remain until the end of 2024. Privacy advocates argue the computer-vision technology, which uses algorithms to detect suspicious behavior or objects, is invasive surveillance because it recognizes people’s physical characteristics and sends alerts to security authorities. The French privacy regulator said the technology comes with risks, but isn’t on a par with facial-recognition cameras that identify specific individuals based on unique features."" https://www. wsj.com/articles/privacy-conce rns-surround-plans-for-ai-camera-surveillance-at-2024-paris-olympics-6e541951",#EU,#France,#Paris,#Surveillance,#Privacy,remixtures,2023-04-12 20:53:27+00:00

Environment,ClimateChange,"Tom Murphy is a professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego. In the piece excerpted below, he presents a darkly humorous and rather grim exercise in attempting to quantify the economic value of bugs... _______________________________ I have pointed out before that humans now vastly outweigh wild mammals, to the point that we only have 2.5 kg of wild land mammal mass left per human on the planet. The trends are falling fast: insect, bird, mammal, amphibian, and fish populations are losing ground to the tune of 1–2% per year, amounting to halving populations over a handful of decades. Inevitably, then, extinctions are up a thousand-fold, and increasing. This is decidedly not good, and perhaps the most glaring sign that modernity is a literal dead-end path. The approach here is to assume that Earth’s ecology would crash without any arthropods (insects, spiders, centipedes, and crustaceans). The same might be said for fish, or birds, or any major group. Bugs (an informal catch-all substitute for arthropods here) are particularly attractive to me for this exercise because they are so crucial in terms of food for others, soil conditioning, pollination, and other services, that it is hard to believe other phyla could carry on without them. Evolution produces a complex interconnected web that cannot be expected to maintain its overall integrity if surgically plucked apart in this way — much as an organism cannot be expected to survive if completely removing any one of many key organs. Therefore, no bugs = no humans. No them, no us. Our economic regime is so narrowly imbecilic as to neglect the very thing that makes its own existence possible. It lacks context. By placing essentially zero (or even negative) value on bugs, it incentivizes its own destruction. It’s the metaphor of cutting off the branch you’re standing on: marvelous efficiency, but to an ultimately disastrous end. How could this short-sightedness happen? Because markets can generate short term gains (profits) without consideration of such elements — for centuries, even. That’s good enough for markets to function and grow to dominate life, complete with insufferable economists bossing us about how it works. But what are centuries against the 500 million years of evolution that gave the Earth its arthropod foundation — not to mention the billions of years that set the stage for even that step?  Apparently, that’s worth nothing, economically? Let’s be clear: the culture has it terribly wrong. Such an attitude can appear to work for a time, but the fate of the biophysical world is steady decline as one commodity after another is monetized, displacing the community of life and making various creatures’ existence progressively more difficult and dismal to the point of non-viability and extinction. Our culture might view this as unfortunate and unintended collateral damage, but not as an existential threat of our own making. What I am saying is that a system powerful enough to destroy ecological health and biodiversity — which we have demonstrated in spades — cannot survive unless it deliberately refrains from using this power. It must invert the cultural hierarchy and place ecosystem health — the vitality of the biodiverse planet — above ALL other considerations. _______________________________ FULL ESSAY -- https://www. resilience.org/stories/2023-11 -08/nothing-without-bugs/ # Science # Environment # Climate # ClimateChange # ClimateCrisis # Biodiversity",#Science,#Environment,#Climate,#ClimateCrisis,#Biodiversity,breadandcircuses,2023-11-14 14:00:10+00:00

Environment,ClimateChange,"Human commerce, petrochemicals, industrialized agriculture, and rampant pollution are killing the biosphere. Our precious and life-sustaining ecosystem is being murdered by greedy capitalists and the craven politicians they own. ____________________________ Two million species are at risk of extinction, a figure that is double previous UN estimates, new analysis has found. While scientists have long documented the decline of species of plants and vertebrates, there has always been significant uncertainty over insects, with the UN making a “tentative estimate” of 10% threatened with extinction in 2019. Since then, more data has been collected on insects, showing the proportion at risk of extinction is much higher than previously estimated. Because there are so many insect species, this doubles the global number of species at risk, according to the paper. Understanding what is happening to global insect populations has been challenging because of the lack of data – but 97% of all animals are invertebrates. Of that group, about 90% are classified as insects. They provide vital ecosystem services: pollinating crops, recycling nutrients into soils, and decomposing waste. “Without insects, our planet will not be able to survive,” said Axel Hochkirch, from the Musée National d’Histoire Naturelle in Luxembourg. ____________________________ Two million species!!!

Environment,Sustainability,"Today's happy # EV story! Had a very busy day and a longer travel time than usual into Melbourne, requiring a fast charge while at my daughter's swimming class (fortunately there is a charger at the Aquatic Centre) and then a drive to Warragul which was still, last I checked, waiting for activation of a new charger. There's a relative charging desert between Moe and the outskirts of Melbourne, and it has always caused me some stress, as I have to drive a bit slower than I'd prefer on the highway to not get range anxiety. We had appointments in Warragul from 1-3pm, and because of the longer drive than usual, I was a bit concerned about getting to the eastern Melbourne metro chargers without going really painfully slowly. I opened Plugshare, wondering if the Bunnings carpark charger had actually been commissioned yet and to my surprise there was a new and apparently active charger listed slightly closer - so curious, and expecting disappointment tbh, I drive over. And I'm both happy and sad - there seems to be a charger working - but it has a Tesla plugged in, curses! ... but it turns out the Tesla owner is just an overly enthusiastic driver who basically heads out to any new charger when it shows up on Plugshare to test it and confirm it's functioning. Yeah! He confirmed he was able to charge, and then I was able to plug in. Amazing! This new charger will save me so much time coming into Melbourne, and will also be good coming back out, though not as big a difference as we can make it to Moe relatively comfortably (but we can't quite get home without top up, and the Moe charger isn't a great spot). The Baw Baw Food Hub is a not-for-profit organic food store, with cafe coming in the next couple of months. They told me the charger was paid for by the Baw Baw Sustainability Network at no cost to them as they are NFP, and they also had 40 solar panels from them too, so charging during the day is extra green. Nice! The store has a great kids play area, so I was able to do some shopping while the little lady was entertained, and head back over once battery was at about 90%.

The Bald Eagle, a sea eagle, is an opportunistic feeder, largely piscivorus and often kleptoparasitic, and endemic to North America. Occasional vagrants appear in Europe.

It bears enough of a load as a result of other U.S. social and economic attributes that brought it to the brink of extinction and continue to threaten it. It's a bird.

Environment,RenewableEnergy,"https:// theshovel.com.au/2023/11/14/au stralia-prepares-fire-season-by-replacing-bushland-with-coal-mines/ The Albanese Government says it is prepared for a potentially devastating summer of bushfires, with work underway to replace dangerous forest and bushland with firesafe open-cut coal mines. Announcing the project today, Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said research showed that 100% of bushfires occurred in areas where trees were present. “If you eliminate the trees, you eliminate the bushfires. You never hear of bushfires in coal mines. Loy Yang has never had a bushfire. Mount Arthur Coal Mine has never had a bushfire. So we’re just following the science – removing the fuel that bushfires rely on”. She said two million hectares of dangerous bushland will be removed and replaced with coal mines. “We want to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to reduce the chance of devastating bushfires for future generations”. Rio Tinto has been awarded the initial tree-removal contract. Although Rio Tinto is not a coal mining company, Plibersek said it was chosen due to its experience in bulldozing important sties without experiencing repercussions. # satire # AusPol # ClimateCrisis # NonLinear # TippingPoints # PositiveFeedbackLoops # FossilFools # RenewableEnergy # ChangeTheSystem # StateCapture # RightToProtest # Biodiversity # WeAreTotallyFscked # Misanthropy",#satire,#AusPol,#ClimateCrisis,#NonLinear,#TippingPoints,MsDropbear425,2023-11-14 04:47:59+00:00

I'm on a mission to check out all the outdoor gyms in my area, in order of distance, according to https:// freeoutdoorfitness.net/ - I'd love to know how to make an account and review the locations, since info provided is minimal, but they seem to only have a login option, no registration 😒 Today was my second attempt to reach this one; a flat tyre screwed up the last try, also happens to be the second location on my list. On the way I saw lots of ducks, stopped to take a photo of a cute little duck family. In another spot I laughed at a duck who tried to attack me while I cruised past. I'm sure it was satisfied that it scared me away effectively. When I reached my destination I spent 15 mins or so using the equipment, enjoyed the view and set off home again. My best 1km time was 2:36 (22.9km/h) All in all, a good trip! 🙂 # bicycling # fitness # OutdoorAdventures",#bicycling,#fitness,,,,Egoplacebo,2023-09-23 07:05:41+00:00

Education,OnlineLearning,"This is a great series of brief interviews between Tim Fawns and an assortment of educators and researchers from across the world on the subject of generative AI and its impact on learning and teaching. The latest (tenth in the series) is with me. Tim asked us all to come up with 3 key statements beforehand that he used to structure the interviews. I only realized that I had to do this on the day of the interview so mine are not very well thought-through, but there follows a summary of very roughly what I would have said about each if my wits were sharper. The reality was, of course, not quite like this. I meandered around a few other ideas and we ran out of time, but I think this captures the gist of what I actually wanted to convey: Key statement 1: Most academics are afraid of AIs being used by students to cheat. I am afraid of AIs being used by teachers to cheat. For much the same reasons that many of us balk at students using, say, ChatGPT to write part or all of their essays or code, I think we should be concerned when teachers use it to replace or supplement their teaching, whether it be for writing course outlines, assessing student work, or acting as intelligent tutors (to name but a few common uses).  The main thing that bothers me is that human teachers (including other learners, authors, and many more) do not simply help learners to achieve specified learning outcomes. In the process, they model ways of thinking, values, attitudes, feelings, and a host of other hard-to-measure tacit and implicit phenomena that relate to ways of being, ways of interacting, ways of responding, and ways of connecting with others. There can be huge value in seeing the world through another’s eyes, of interacting with them, adapting your responses, seeing how they adapt to yours, and so on. This is a critical part of how we learn the soft stuff, the ways of doing things, the meaning, the social value, the connections with our own motivations, and so on. In short, education is as much about being a human being, living in human communities, as it is about learning facts and skills. Even when we are not interacting but, say, simply reading a book, we are learning not just the contents but the ways the contents are presented, the quirks, the passions, the ways the authors think of their readers, their implicit beliefs, and so on. While a generative AI can mimic this pretty well, it is by nature a kind of average, a blurry reconstruction mashed up from countless examples of the work of real humans. It is human-like, not human. It can mimic a wide assortment of nearly-humans without identity, without purpose, without persistence, without skin in the game. As things currently stand (though this will change) it is also likely to be pretty bland – good enough, but not great. It might be argued that this is better than nothing at all, or that it augments rather than replaces human teachers, or it helps with relatively mundance chores, or it provides personalized support and efficiencies in learning hard skills, or it allows teachers to focus on those human aspects, or even that using a generative AI is a good way of learning in itself . Right now and in the near future, this may be true because we are in a system on the verge of disruption, not yet in the thick of it, and we come to it with all our existing skills and structures intact. My concern is what happens as it scales and becomes ubiquitous; as the bean-counting focus on efficiencies that relate solely to measurable outcomes increasingly crowd out the time spent with other humans; as the generative AIs feed on one another becoming more and more divorced from their human originals; as the skills of teaching that are replaced by AIs atrophy in the next generation; as time we spend with one another is replaced with time spent with not-quite human simulacra; as the AIs themselves become more and more a part of our cognitive apparatus in both what is learned and how we learn it. There are Monkeys’ Paws all the way down the line: for everything that might improved, there are at least as many things that can and will get worse. Key statement 2: We and our technologies are inherently intertwingled so it makes no more sense to exclude AIs from the classroom than it would to exclude, say, books or writing. The big questions are about what we need to keep. Our cognition is fundamentally intertwingled with the technologies that we use, both physical and cognitive, and those technologies are intertwingled with one another, and that’s how our collective intelligence emerges. For all the vital human aspects mentioned above, a significant part of the educational process is concerned with building cognitive gadgets that enable us to participate in the technologies of our cultures, from poetry and long division to power stations and web design. Through that participation our cognition is highly distributed, and our intelligence is fundamentally collective. Now that generative AIs are part of that, it would be crazy to exclude them from classrooms or from their use in assessments. It does, however, raise more than a few questions about what cognitive activities we still need to keep for ourselves. Technologies expand or augment what we can do unaided. Writing, say, allows us (among other things) to extend our memories. This creates many adjacent possibles , including sharing them with others, and allowing us to construct more complex ideas using scaffolding that would be very difficult to construct on our own because our memories are not that great. Central to the nature of writing is that, as with most technologies, we don’t just use it but we participate in its enactment, performing part of the orchestration ourselves (for instance we choose what words and ideas we write – the soft stuff), but also being part of its orchestration (e.g we must typically spell words and use grammar sufficiently uniformly that others can understand them – the hard stuff). In the past, we used to do nearly all of that writing by hand. Handwriting was a hard skill that had to be learned well enough that others could read what we have written, a process that typically required years of training and practice, demanding mastery of a wide range of technical proficiencies from spelling and punctuation to manual dexterity and the ability to sharpen a quill/fill a fountain pen/insert a cartridge, etc. To an increasingly large extent we have now offloaded many of those hard skills, first to typewriters and now to computers. While some of the soft aspects of handwriting have been lost – the cognitive processes that affect how we write and how we think, the expressiveness of the never-perfect ways we write letters on a page, etc – this was a sensible thing to do. From a functional perspective, text produced by a computer is far more consistent, far more readable, far more adaptable, far more reusable, and far more easily communicated. Why should we devote so much effort and time to learning to be part of a machine when a machine can do that part for us, and do it better? Something that can free us from having to act as an inflexible machine seems, by and large, like a good thing. If we don’t have to do it ourselves then we can spend more time and effort on what we do, how we do it, the soft stuff, the creative stuff, the problem-solving stuff, and so on. It allows us to be more capable, to reach further, to communicate more clearly. There are some really big issues relating to the ways that the constraints of handwriting such as the relative difficulty of making corrections, the physicality of the movements, and the ways our brains are changed by handwriting that result in different ways of thinking, some of which may be very valuable. But, as Postman wrote , all technologies are Faustian bargains involving losses and harms as well as gains and benefits. A technology that thrives is usually (at least in the short term) one in which the gains are perceived to outweigh the losses. And, even when largely replaced, old technologies seldom if ever die , so it is usually possible to retrieve what is lost, at least until the skills atrophy, components are no longer made, or they are designed to die (old printers with chip-protected cartridges that are no longer made, for instance). What is fundamentally different about generative AIs, however, is that they allow us to offload exactly the soft, creative, problem solving aspects of our cognition, that technologies normally support and expand, to a machine. They provide extremely good pastiches of human thought and creativity that can act well enough to be considered as drop-in replacements. In many cases, they can do so a lot better – from the point of view of someone seeing only the outputs – than an average human. An AI image generator can draw a great deal better than me, for instance. But, given that these machines are now part of our extended, intertwingled minds, what is left for us? What parts of our minds should they or will they replace? How can we use them without losing the capacity to do at least some of the things they do better or as well as us? What happens if we lack those cognitive gadgets we never installed in our minds because AIs did it for us? This is not the same as, say, not knowing how to make a bow and arrow or write in cuneiform. Even when atrophied, such skills can be recovered. This is the stuff that we learn the other stuff for . It is especially important in the field of education which, traditionally at least, has been deeply concerned with cultivating the hard skills largely if not solely so that we can use them creatively, socially and productively once they are learned. If the machines are doing that for us, what is our role? This is not (yet) Kurzweil’s singularity , the moment when machines exceed our own intelligence and start to develop on their own, but it is the (drawn-out, fragmented) moment that machines have become capable of participating in soft, creative technologies on at least equal footing to humans. That matters. This leads to my final key statement. Key statement 3: AIs create countless new adjacent possible empty niches. They can augment what we can do, but we need to go full-on Amish when deciding whether they should replace what we already do. Every new creation in the world opens up new and inherently unprestatable adjacent possible empty niches for further creation, not just in how it can be used as part of new assemblies but in how it connects with those that already exist. It’s the exponential dynamic ratchet underlying natural evolution as much as technology, and it is what results in the complexity of the universe. The rapid acceleration in use and complexity of generative AIs – itself enabled by the adjacent possibles of the already highly disruptive Internet – that we have seen over the past couple of years has resulted in a positive explosion of new adjacent possibles, in turn spawning others, and so on, at a hitherto unprecedented scale and speed. This is exactly what we should expect in an exponentially growing system. It makes it increasingly difficult to predict what will happen next, or what skills, attitudes, and values we will need to deal with it, or how we will affected by it. As the number of possible scenarios increases at the same exponential rate, and the time between major changes gets ever shorter, patterns of thinking, ways of doing things, skills we need, and the very structures of our societies must change in unpredictable ways, too. Occupations, including in education, are already being massively disrupted, for better and for worse. Deeply embedded systems, from assessment for credentials to the mass media, are suddenly and catastrophically breaking.  Legislation, regulations, resistance from groups of affected individuals, and other checks and balances may slightly alter the rate of change, but likely not enough to matter. Education serves both a stabilizing and a generative role in society, but educators are at least as unprepared and at least as disrupted as anyone else. We don’t – in fact we cannot – know what kind of world we are preparing our students for, and the generative technologies that now form part of our cognition are changing faster than we can follow. Any AI literacies we develop will be obsolete in the blink of an eye. And, remember, generative AIs are not just replacing hard skills. They are replacing the soft ones, the things that we use our hard skills to accomplish. This is why I believe we would do well to heed the example of the Amish, who (contrary to popular belief) are not opposed to modern technologies but, in their communities, debate and discuss the merits and disadvantages of any technology that is available, considering the ways in which it might affect or conflict with their values, only adopting those agreed to be, on balance, good, and only doing so in ways that accord with those values. Different communities make different choices according to their contexts and needs. In order to do that, we have to have values in the first place. But what are the values that matter in education? With a few exceptions (laws and regulations being the main ones) technologies do not determine how we will act but, through the ways they integrate with our shared cognition, existing technologies, and practices, they have a lot of momentum and, unchecked, generative AIs will inherit the values associated with what currently exists. In educational systems that are increasingly regulated by government mandates that focus on nothing but their economic contributions to industry, where success or failure is measured solely by proxy criteria like predetermined outcomes of learning and enrolments, where a millennium of path dependencies still embodies patterns of teacher control and indoctrination that worked for mediaeval monks and skillsets that suited the demands of factory owners during the industrial revolution, this will not end well. Now seems the time we most need to reassert and double down on the human, the social, the cultural, the societal, the personal, and the tacit value of our institutions. This is the time to talk about those values, locally and globally. This is the time to examine what matters, what we care about, what we must not lose, and why we must not lose it. Tomorrow it will be too late. I think this is a time of great risk but it is also a time of great opportunity, a chance to reflect on and examine the value and nature of education itself. Some of us have been wanting to have these conversations for decades.

Education,University,"Racisme ordinaire dans la forteresse européenne suprématiste blanche ordinaire (ici au Royaume Uni, mais en France c'est pareil, voire pire : demandez aux étudiants, artistes, chercheurs, du Niger, du Mali, et du Burkina Faso ce qu'ils en pensent) + un sexisme tout aussi ordinaire (voir la lettre adressée à la gamine de 6 ans : ""C'est votre mère qui a pris la décision personnelle de partir pour le Royaume-Uni"".) Traduction via Deepl : ""Une cruauté impensable"" : Une experte kenyane travaillant à l'université de Bristol se voit refuser un visa pour sa fille de six ans Des collègues furieux dénoncent la décision selon laquelle il n'y a ""aucun motif de compassion"" pour permettre à l'enfant de rejoindre sa mère. Le Dr Doseline Kiguru, experte kényane en littérature mondiale, était aux anges lorsqu'elle a obtenu un poste permanent à l'université de Bristol. Mais tout a changé la semaine dernière, lorsque le ministère de l'intérieur a refusé d'autoriser sa fille de six ans à la rejoindre. ""Les universitaires affirment qu'il n'est pas rare que les enfants des chercheurs soient interdits de séjour, mais les parents sont généralement trop effrayés pour en parler publiquement. Mme Kiguru a déclaré ce week-end qu'elle était ""dévastée"" par la décision ""horrible"" d'interdire à sa fille de s'installer au Royaume-Uni et qu'elle ne pouvait supporter ""de penser à la solitude et à l'isolement dans lesquels elle se sent"" au Kenya. Mme Kiguru a déclaré que sa fille lui demandait chaque jour au téléphone quand elle viendrait la chercher. ""Bien sûr, un enfant ne comprend pas ces complexités [liées aux visas]. Elle pense que je l'ai quittée. Elle est venue pour la première fois à Bristol en 2021 en tant qu'associée de recherche dans le cadre d'un projet financé par l'UE à hauteur de 1,3 million de livres sterling sur l'activisme littéraire en Afrique. Son travail sur le terrain l'obligeant à passer beaucoup de temps au Kenya, la famille a décidé qu'il n'était pas nécessaire de déraciner sa fille. Cependant, lorsqu'elle s'est vu offrir un poste permanent de maître de conférences, elle s'est engagée à commencer une nouvelle vie au Royaume-Uni avec sa fille. Son mari, également universitaire, ne peut pas s'occuper de sa fille parce qu'il voyage beaucoup pour ses recherches, mais il espère s'installer au Royaume-Uni. Mme Kiguru est retournée au Kenya pour demander le visa de sa fille en juillet. Ne s'attendant à aucun problème, elle l'a inscrite dans une école primaire de Bristol à partir de septembre et lui a acheté son uniforme. La procédure de demande de visa devrait prendre 15 jours ouvrables, mais ce n'est que lorsque l'université de Bristol est intervenue au début du mois de novembre qu'elle a découvert que la demande de sa fille avait été rejetée au début du mois d'octobre. Il ne lui reste plus qu'une semaine pour faire appel. Dans sa décision de rejet, le ministère de l'intérieur a indiqué qu'il ne voyait ""aucun motif de compassion"" permettant à l'enfant de rejoindre sa mère. La lettre, adressée à la fillette de six ans, ajoutait : ""C'est votre mère qui a pris la décision personnelle de partir pour le Royaume-Uni"". Une collègue soutenant l'appel de Kiguru, qui a souhaité rester anonyme par crainte de représailles du ministère de l'intérieur avec son propre visa, a déclaré : ""Ils laissent entendre que Doseline a choisi de rejoindre sa mère au Royaume-Uni : ""Ils laissent entendre que Doseline a choisi de quitter sa fille. L'hostilité de ce raisonnement, qui ne peut provenir que du racisme et de la misogynie, m'a coupé le souffle"". Madhu Krishnan, professeur de littérature africaine, mondiale et comparée à l'université de Bristol, a déclaré : ""La décision de séparer un jeune enfant de sa mère pour des motifs aussi fallacieux est un acte d'une cruauté inconcevable, dont nous sommes malheureusement devenus familiers ces dernières années. Elle a décrit Kiguru comme un ""érudit de renommée mondiale"" et a déclaré que sa perte serait ""fortement ressentie"" si cette décision l'obligeait à quitter le Royaume-Uni. Un rapport récent de la Royal Society a révélé que les visas universitaires étaient souvent rejetés pour des raisons ""arbitraires et subjectives"". Selon ce rapport, les ressortissants africains qui demandent un visa de visiteur - dont les scientifiques ont besoin pour assister à des conférences de recherche au Royaume-Uni - ont trois à quatre fois plus de chances d'être rejetés que les demandeurs d'Asie de l'Est. La société a dénoncé les augmentations ""disproportionnées"" des frais de visa, prévues à partir de l'année prochaine, comme une ""taxe punitive sur le talent"", les meilleurs chercheurs venant au Royaume-Uni devant faire face à des coûts jusqu'à 10 fois supérieurs à ceux d'autres nations scientifiques de premier plan. https://www. theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/n ov/11/kenyan-expert-bristol-university-denied-visa-daughter # racism # university # scholar",#racism,#university,#scholar,,,danahilliot,2023-11-11 17:32:08+00:00

Every time that mouth sucks a dick, it lowers the supply of dicks, raising the # value of every other dick, including yours. You raise the value of your dick by sucking other people's dicks.
