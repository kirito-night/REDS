create a soft robotic implant that can work to fight fibrotic encapsulation and deliver drugs despite the presence of fibrous scar tissue  the device  which the researchers have termed the fibrosensing dynamic soft reservoir  fsdsr   is designed to reside in the body for extended periods and deliver drugs  however  the immune system typically recognizes such medical implants as foreign  and walls them off with a thick layer of fibrous scar tissue  limiting drug diffusion and leading to eventual failure  this new soft robotic implant can inflate and deflate  like a sea creature  which helps to reduce the amount of scar tissue that is deposited on its surface  however  in a key development  the researchers have also furnished the implant with a sensor that can measure the amount of scar tissue present on the device  allowing it to use   ai   to calculate how to release the same dose of drug  regardless of the amount of fibrosis present   p   p the foreign body response is a key hurdle in developing more effective medical implants  such as an artificial pancreas  the thick scar tissue that builds up on such implants greatly reduces their lifespan and limits their ability to sense their environment and release drugs in response  techniques to reduce this biofouling  such as surface patterning on medical implants  have met with mixed success   p   p to address this  these researchers have created a soft robotic drug delivery implant that can reduce the foreign body response by actively inflating and deflating  this movement appears to confuse the body  which can’t deposit as much scar tissue on the device  this robotic actuation also serves another purpose  by helping to push liquid drug out of the device into its surroundings  so far  so good  but in this latest study  the researchers took it a step further by introducing   artificial intelligence    according to a press release from the university of galway   p   p they incorporated a sensor membrane into the device that can sense the amount of biofouling that has occurred  then  machine learning calculates how many actuations  and of what force  the device will need to apply to squeeze a consistent dose of drug through the surrounding fibrous capsule  in this way  the technology can continue to deliver consistent drug dosing even if it is heavily covered in fibrotic scar tissue  the technology may pave the way for fully autonomous implants that can monitor their environment and make adjustments as required to achieve their goals   p   p   this is a new area of research that can have implications in other places and is not solely limited for the treatment of diabetes ” said garry duffy  a researcher involved in the study  “our discovery could provide consistent and responsive dosing over long periods  without clinician involvement  enhancing efficacy and reducing the need for device replacement because of fibrosis     p   p study in journal  em science robotics  em    a

Education,OnlineLearning,this is a great series of brief interviews between tim fawns and an assortment of educators and researchers from across the world on the subject of generative ai and its impact on learning and teaching  the latest  tenth in the series  is with me  tim asked us all to come up with 3 key statements beforehand that he used to structure the interviews  i only realized that i had to do this on the day of the interview so mine are not very well thought through  but there follows a summary of very roughly what i would have said about each if my wits were sharper  the reality was  of course  not quite like this  i meandered around a few other ideas and we ran out of time  but i think this captures the gist of what i actually wanted to convey  key statement 1  most academics are afraid of ais being used by students to cheat  i am afraid of ais being used by teachers to cheat  for much the same reasons that many of us balk at students using  say  chatgpt to write part or all of their essays or code  i think we should be concerned when teachers use it to replace or supplement their teaching  whether it be for writing course outlines  assessing student work  or acting as intelligent tutors  to name but a few common uses    the main thing that bothers me is that human teachers  including other learners  authors  and many more  do not simply help learners to achieve specified learning outcomes  in the process  they model ways of thinking  values  attitudes  feelings  and a host of other hard to measure tacit and implicit phenomena that relate to ways of being  ways of interacting  ways of responding  and ways of connecting with others  there can be huge value in seeing the world through another’s eyes  of interacting with them  adapting your responses  seeing how they adapt to yours  and so on  this is a critical part of how we learn the soft stuff  the ways of doing things  the meaning  the social value  the connections with our own motivations  and so on  in short  education is as much about being a human being  living in human communities  as it is about learning facts and skills  even when we are not interacting but  say  simply reading a book  we are learning not just the contents but the ways the contents are presented  the quirks  the passions  the ways the authors think of their readers  their implicit beliefs  and so on  while a generative ai can mimic this pretty well  it is by nature a kind of average  a blurry reconstruction mashed up from countless examples of the work of real humans  it is human like  not human  it can mimic a wide assortment of nearly humans without identity  without purpose  without persistence  without skin in the game  as things currently stand  though this will change  it is also likely to be pretty bland – good enough  but not great  it might be argued that this is better than nothing at all  or that it augments rather than replaces human teachers  or it helps with relatively mundance chores  or it provides personalized support and efficiencies in learning hard skills  or it allows teachers to focus on those human aspects  or even that using a generative ai is a good way of learning in itself   right now and in the near future  this may be true because we are in a system on the verge of disruption  not yet in the thick of it  and we come to it with all our existing skills and structures intact  my concern is what happens as it scales and becomes ubiquitous  as the bean counting focus on efficiencies that relate solely to measurable outcomes increasingly crowd out the time spent with other humans  as the generative ais feed on one another becoming more and more divorced from their human originals  as the skills of teaching that are replaced by ais atrophy in the next generation  as time we spend with one another is replaced with time spent with not quite human simulacra  as the ais themselves become more and more a part of our cognitive apparatus in both what is learned and how we learn it  there are monkeys’ paws all the way down the line  for everything that might improved  there are at least as many things that can and will get worse  key statement 2  we and our technologies are inherently intertwingled so it makes no more sense to exclude ais from the classroom than it would to exclude  say  books or writing  the big questions are about what we need to keep  our cognition is fundamentally intertwingled with the technologies that we use  both physical and cognitive  and those technologies are intertwingled with one another  and that’s how our collective intelligence emerges  for all the vital human aspects mentioned above  a significant part of the educational process is concerned with building cognitive gadgets that enable us to participate in the technologies of our cultures  from poetry and long division to power stations and web design  through that participation our cognition is highly distributed  and our intelligence is fundamentally collective  now that generative ais are part of that  it would be crazy to exclude them from classrooms or from their use in assessments  it does  however  raise more than a few questions about what cognitive activities we still need to keep for ourselves  technologies expand or augment what we can do unaided  writing  say  allows us  among other things  to extend our memories  this creates many adjacent possibles   including sharing them with others  and allowing us to construct more complex ideas using scaffolding that would be very difficult to construct on our own because our memories are not that great  central to the nature of writing is that  as with most technologies  we don’t just use it but we participate in its enactment  performing part of the orchestration ourselves  for instance we choose what words and ideas we write – the soft stuff   but also being part of its orchestration  e g we must typically spell words and use grammar sufficiently uniformly that others can understand them – the hard stuff   in the past  we used to do nearly all of that writing by hand  handwriting was a hard skill that had to be learned well enough that others could read what we have written  a process that typically required years of training and practice  demanding mastery of a wide range of technical proficiencies from spelling and punctuation to manual dexterity and the ability to sharpen a quill fill a fountain pen insert a cartridge  etc  to an increasingly large extent we have now offloaded many of those hard skills  first to typewriters and now to computers  while some of the soft aspects of handwriting have been lost – the cognitive processes that affect how we write and how we think  the expressiveness of the never perfect ways we write letters on a page  etc – this was a sensible thing to do  from a functional perspective  text produced by a computer is far more consistent  far more readable  far more adaptable  far more reusable  and far more easily communicated  why should we devote so much effort and time to learning to be part of a machine when a machine can do that part for us  and do it better  something that can free us from having to act as an inflexible machine seems  by and large  like a good thing  if we don’t have to do it ourselves then we can spend more time and effort on what we do  how we do it  the soft stuff  the creative stuff  the problem solving stuff  and so on  it allows us to be more capable  to reach further  to communicate more clearly  there are some really big issues relating to the ways that the constraints of handwriting such as the relative difficulty of making corrections  the physicality of the movements  and the ways our brains are changed by handwriting that result in different ways of thinking  some of which may be very valuable  but  as postman wrote   all technologies are faustian bargains involving losses and harms as well as gains and benefits  a technology that thrives is usually  at least in the short term  one in which the gains are perceived to outweigh the losses  and  even when largely replaced  old technologies seldom if ever die   so it is usually possible to retrieve what is lost  at least until the skills atrophy  components are no longer made  or they are designed to die  old printers with chip protected cartridges that are no longer made  for instance   what is fundamentally different about generative ais  however  is that they allow us to offload exactly the soft  creative  problem solving aspects of our cognition  that technologies normally support and expand  to a machine  they provide extremely good pastiches of human thought and creativity that can act well enough to be considered as drop in replacements  in many cases  they can do so a lot better – from the point of view of someone seeing only the outputs – than an average human  an ai image generator can draw a great deal better than me  for instance  but  given that these machines are now part of our extended  intertwingled minds  what is left for us  what parts of our minds should they or will they replace  how can we use them without losing the capacity to do at least some of the things they do better or as well as us  what happens if we lack those cognitive gadgets we never installed in our minds because ais did it for us  this is not the same as  say  not knowing how to make a bow and arrow or write in cuneiform  even when atrophied  such skills can be recovered  this is the stuff that we learn the other stuff for   it is especially important in the field of education which  traditionally at least  has been deeply concerned with cultivating the hard skills largely if not solely so that we can use them creatively  socially and productively once they are learned  if the machines are doing that for us  what is our role  this is not  yet  kurzweil’s singularity   the moment when machines exceed our own intelligence and start to develop on their own  but it is the  drawn out  fragmented  moment that machines have become capable of participating in soft  creative technologies on at least equal footing to humans  that matters  this leads to my final key statement  key statement 3  ais create countless new adjacent possible empty niches  they can augment what we can do  but we need to go full on amish when deciding whether they should replace what we already do  every new creation in the world opens up new and inherently unprestatable adjacent possible empty niches for further creation  not just in how it can be used as part of new assemblies but in how it connects with those that already exist  it’s the exponential dynamic ratchet underlying natural evolution as much as technology  and it is what results in the complexity of the universe  the rapid acceleration in use and complexity of generative ais – itself enabled by the adjacent possibles of the already highly disruptive internet – that we have seen over the past couple of years has resulted in a positive explosion of new adjacent possibles  in turn spawning others  and so on  at a hitherto unprecedented scale and speed  this is exactly what we should expect in an exponentially growing system  it makes it increasingly difficult to predict what will happen next  or what skills  attitudes  and values we will need to deal with it  or how we will affected by it  as the number of possible scenarios increases at the same exponential rate  and the time between major changes gets ever shorter  patterns of thinking  ways of doing things  skills we need  and the very structures of our societies must change in unpredictable ways  too  occupations  including in education  are already being massively disrupted  for better and for worse  deeply embedded systems  from assessment for credentials to the mass media  are suddenly and catastrophically breaking   legislation  regulations  resistance from groups of affected individuals  and other checks and balances may slightly alter the rate of change  but likely not enough to matter  education serves both a stabilizing and a generative role in society  but educators are at least as unprepared and at least as disrupted as anyone else  we don’t – in fact we cannot – know what kind of world we are preparing our students for  and the generative technologies that now form part of our cognition are changing faster than we can follow  any ai literacies we develop will be obsolete in the blink of an eye  and  remember  generative ais are not just replacing hard skills  they are replacing the soft ones  the things that we use our hard skills to accomplish  this is why i believe we would do well to heed the example of the amish  who  contrary to popular belief  are not opposed to modern technologies but  in their communities  debate and discuss the merits and disadvantages of any technology that is available  considering the ways in which it might affect or conflict with their values  only adopting those agreed to be  on balance  good  and only doing so in ways that accord with those values  different communities make different choices according to their contexts and needs  in order to do that  we have to have values in the first place  but what are the values that matter in education  with a few exceptions  laws and regulations being the main ones  technologies do not determine how we will act but  through the ways they integrate with our shared cognition  existing technologies  and practices  they have a lot of momentum and  unchecked  generative ais will inherit the values associated with what currently exists  in educational systems that are increasingly regulated by government mandates that focus on nothing but their economic contributions to industry  where success or failure is measured solely by proxy criteria like predetermined outcomes of learning and enrolments  where a millennium of path dependencies still embodies patterns of teacher control and indoctrination that worked for mediaeval monks and skillsets that suited the demands of factory owners during the industrial revolution  this will not end well  now seems the time we most need to reassert and double down on the human  the social  the cultural  the societal  the personal  and the tacit value of our institutions  this is the time to talk about those values  locally and globally  this is the time to examine what matters  what we care about  what we must not lose  and why we must not lose it  tomorrow it will be too late  i think this is a time of great risk but it is also a time of great opportunity  a chance to reflect on and examine the value and nature of education itself  some of us have been wanting to have these conversations for decades

Education,OnlineLearning,research  writing  and creative process in open and distance education  tales from the field is a great new book about how researchers in the field of open  online  and distance education go about writing and or their advice to newcomers in the field  more than that  it is about the process of writing in general  containing stories  recommendations  methods  tricks  and principles that pretty much anyone who writes  from students to experienced authors  would find useful and interesting  it is published as an open book  with a very open cc by nc licence  that is free to read or download as well as to purchase in paper form  ok  full disclosure  i am a bit biased  i have a chapter in it  and many of the rest are by friends and aquaintances  the editor and author of one of the chapters is dianne conrad  the foreword is by terry anderson  and the list of authors includes some of the most luminous  widely cited names in the field  with a wealth of experience and many thousands of publications between them  the full list includes david starr glass  pamela ryan   junhong xiao  jennifer roberts  aras bozkurt  catherine cronin  randy garrison  tony bates  mark nichols  marguerite koole  with michael cottrell  janet okoko   kristine dreaver charles   and paul prinsloo  apart from being a really good idea that fills a really important gap in the market  what i love most about the book is the diversity of the chapters  there’s everything from practical advice on how to structure an effective paper  to meandering reflective streams of consciousness that read like poetry  to academic discussions of identity and culture  it contains a lot of great stories that present a rich variety of approaches and processes  offering far from uniform suggestions about how best to write or why it is worth doing in the first place  though the contributors are all researchers in the field of open and distance learning  nearly all of us started out on very different career paths  so we come at it with a wide range of disciplinary  epistemological and stylistic frameworks  dianne has done a great job of weaving all of these different perspectives together into a coherent tapestry  not just a simple collection of essays  the diversity is also a direct result of the instructions dianne sent with the original proposal  which provides a pretty good description of the general approach and content that you will find in the book  i am asking colleagues  as researchers  scholars  teachers  and writers in our field  odl   to reflect on and write about your research writing process  including topics such as      your background and training as a scholar     your scholarly interests     why you research write     how you research write     what philosophies guide your work      conflicts   barriers      mentors  opportunities     reflections  insights  sorrows     advice  takeaways     anything else you feel is relevant the “personal stuff ” as listed above  should serve as jump off points to scholarly issues  that is  this isn’t intended to be a memoir or even a full on reflective  use the opportunity to reflect on your own work as a lead in up to the scholarly issues you want to address promote explore  the aim of the book is to inform hesitant scholars  new scholars  and fledgling nervous writers of our time tested processes  and to spread awareness of the behind the curtain work involved in publishing and “being heard ” my own chapter   chapter 3  on being written   starts with rather a lot of sailing metaphors that tack around the ways that writing participates in my cognition and connects us  moves back to the land with a slight clunk and some geeky practical advice about my approach to notetaking and the roles of the tools that i use for the purpose  thence saunters on to the value of academic blogging and how i feel about it  and finally to a conclusion that frames the rest in something akin to a broader theory of complexity and cognition  all of it draws heavily from themes and theories explored in my recently published  also open  book  how education works  teaching  technology  and technique   for all the stretched metaphors  meandering sidetracks  and clunky continuity i’m quite pleased with how it came out  most of the other chapters are better structured and organized  and most have more direct advice on the process  from start to finish   but they all tell rich  personal  and enlightening stories that are fascinating to read  especially if you know the people writing them or are familiar with their work  however  while the context  framing  and some of the advice is specific to the field of open and distance learning  the vast majority of lessons and advice are about academic writing in general  whatever field you identify with  if you ever have to write anything then there’s probably something in it for you  originally posted at     landing athabascau ca
