I was driving in my car while running errands, so I basically reiterated the arguments I had made in the Email about working instead on a comprehensive US privacy policy rather than punish TikTok for things US companies could and were already doing. But I really missed the opportunity to share with him the absolute pleasure I get out of TikTok, the tears I get streaming down my face from laughing so hard, and the admiration of the creative content I come across daily on that platform. I don't know if Jon Ossoff has any staffer that monitors Mastodon, but if so, I hope I can convey what a pleasure TikTok has been in my world where so many other things are sources of discomfort, disappointment, and division. # Georgia # Senate # nationalpolitics # antiRESTRICTact",#JonOssoff,#TikTok,#Georgia,#Senate,#nationalpolitics,bboemanns,2023-04-23 20:06:51+00:00

It’s not just that we should decide whether we really need to run some application, but at a deeper level, we’re now increasingly wasteful in the way we run software anyway. It’s the difference between talking about reducing tailpipe emissions by not taking extra trips to the store vs not using highly emitting vehicles in the first place, for all trips, vital and optional. Computing resources have become so generous that we run software today that requires far overpowered computers to do even simple tasks. We use inefficient libraries with a ton of overhead, because it’s easier or trendier to program them. Heck, we’re even guilty of that here on Fediverse. Have you see how inefficient the design of this platform is? But… that’s just the direction # computing has gone, much to the chagrin of older generations.

Science,QuantumPhysics,"# QuantumPhysics Yesterday I learned a little more about the double slit experiment. Turns out that it's not just human consciousness that affects the output, but any measurement. The problem is that we don't know how to measure things immaterially. We like to think of our measurements as processes that don't affect the purity of the sample taken. But such a thing is just impossible when we talk about quantum physics. Every time a quantum wave is measured it interacts with whatever is measuring it, and then it collapses into ""particle mode."" Now, what nobody told you is that, for human consciousness to be able to ""measure"" at a distance, therefore, it must be both physical and incorporeal. The implications are embarrassing for 99.999% of human beings on this planet (and some dogs.)",,,,,,inventor,2023-10-04 21:31:34+00:00

Hilariously, it's from a movie I haven't seen. Featuring a bunch of rock/metal vocalists separate from their bands was a great and successful experiment. And most of the regular tracks are killer, like ""Change"" by Deftones or ""Before I'm Dead' by Kidneythieves. Although ""Not Meant For Me"" is my pick for best track. # 30DayMovieChallenge # movies",#30DayMovieChallenge,#movies,,,,auzzy,2023-10-12 02:12:25+00:00

News,CitizenJournalism,"@ philip I'm curious about how the state determined the order in which level crossings in Victoria will be removed. Was it a simple model based on traffic volume at major intersections (e.g., Bell Street). Did it include time-of-day metrics? Commercial traffic versus private commuter vehicles? There has to be an Excel spreadsheet. My guess is that whatever method was used has been conveniently deemed ""commercial in confidence"" and we won't know. Even with an FoI request. Noting that ""Commercial in Confidence"" does not exist to protect proprietary professional methodologies, as we are told. Rather, it is an effective way to hide information that could be used in future litigation. # CitizenJournalism",,,,,,jmcleod,2023-07-10 22:58:04+00:00

News,CitizenJournalism,"Imagine an online space where you could go to not only receive the latest news about actions in your locality, but also share information about campaigns or events – without driving more traffic to the digital capitalists of Facebook and Twitter, who continue to ban anti-fascists. Those who recall # IndyMedia will not only be familiar with the concept, but also lament its lack of editorial oversight and eventual collapse under the weight of conspiracy theories and anti-Semitism that have no place in antifascist media. Last year, the # IWW celebrated writers at The Canary overthrowing management and becoming a workers’ co-operative. But even now, much like the # BylineTimes (a private company with directors), # TheCanary still faces a battle for online clicks within the commercial landscape. It’s useful to remember that the term “freedom of the press” did not originally mean the media marketplace, but literally the freedom to publish using a printing press: # CitizenJournalism , based on the spirit of # MutualAid . It is mutual aid that inspired the name of France’s # MutuNetwork that today has over a dozen regional websites in not just # France , but also # Switzerland and # Austria , reporting on striking workers, occupying students, and other local struggles, operated in a non-hierarchical but also non-commercial way – true citizen journalism, with a set of agreed standards. Several of us media activists have started to discuss how we could develop Local Autonomous Media (or # LoAM ) in the UK after hearing about the success of # Mutu . We’ve set up chat groups and even held Jitsi meetings online with Mutu contributors in Switzerland. And we’re looking to set in place the building blocks to create something similar in the UK.

News,CitizenJournalism,"# CitizenJournalism story of the week features a compelling mix of crimes against ecosystems.  These crimes are perpetuated by Chicago-based Exelon Corp and none other than PG&E, which itself is also precariously bankrupt. TL;DR Summary: Exelon Corp  is NOT a ""clean"" or ""renewable"" energy company; it is bankrupt and desperate to continue polluting.  As operator of the Conowingo Dam, it is actually dispersing ecosystem-killing pollutants into the already sick and weak Chesapeake Bay. ""The bay's hypoxic (low oxygen) and anoxic (no oxygen) zones are caused by excess nutrient pollution, primarily from agriculture and wastewater. The excess nutrients stimulate an overgrowth of algae, which then sinks and decomposes in the water. The resulting low oxygen levels are insufficient to support most marine life and habitats in near-bottom waters, threatening the bay's crabs, oysters and other fisheries. This summer's Chesapeake Bay hypoxic or ""dead zone,"" an area of low oxygen that can kill fish and other aquatic life, is expected to be about 2.1 cubic miles, while the volume of water with no oxygen is predicted to be between 0.49 and 0.63 cubic miles during early and late summer.""

The country’s national assembly approved a bill last month authorizing companies to test computer-vision cameras to use at stadiums and nearby transportation hubs to identify security threats during the Olympics. The law, which will likely be enacted in the coming months, would allow the cameras to remain until the end of 2024. Privacy advocates argue the computer-vision technology, which uses algorithms to detect suspicious behavior or objects, is invasive surveillance because it recognizes people’s physical characteristics and sends alerts to security authorities. The French privacy regulator said the technology comes with risks, but isn’t on a par with facial-recognition cameras that identify specific individuals based on unique features."" https://www. wsj.com/articles/privacy-conce rns-surround-plans-for-ai-camera-surveillance-at-2024-paris-olympics-6e541951",#EU,#France,#Paris,#Surveillance,#Privacy,remixtures,2023-04-12 20:53:27+00:00

The device, which the researchers have termed the FibroSensing Dynamic Soft Reservoir (FSDSR), is designed to reside in the body for extended periods and deliver drugs. However, the immune system typically recognizes such medical implants as foreign, and walls them off with a thick layer of fibrous scar tissue, limiting drug diffusion and leading to eventual failure. This new soft robotic implant can inflate and deflate, like a sea creature, which helps to reduce the amount of scar tissue that is deposited on its surface. However, in a key development, the researchers have also furnished the implant with a sensor that can measure the amount of scar tissue present on the device, allowing it to use &;AI&; to calculate how to release the same dose of drug, regardless of the amount of fibrosis present.</p> <p>The foreign body response is a key hurdle in developing more effective medical implants, such as an artificial pancreas. The thick scar tissue that builds up on such implants greatly reduces their lifespan and limits their ability to sense their environment and release drugs in response. Techniques to reduce this biofouling, such as surface patterning on medical implants, have met with mixed success.</p> <p>To address this, these researchers have created a soft robotic drug delivery implant that can reduce the foreign body response by actively inflating and deflating. This movement appears to confuse the body, which can’t deposit as much scar tissue on the device. This robotic actuation also serves another purpose, by helping to push liquid drug out of the device into its surroundings. So far, so good, but in this latest study, the researchers took it a step further by introducing &;artificial intelligence,&; according to a press release from the University of Galway.</p> <p>They incorporated a sensor membrane into the device that can sense the amount of biofouling that has occurred. Then, machine learning calculates how many actuations, and of what force, the device will need to apply to squeeze a consistent dose of drug through the surrounding fibrous capsule. In this way, the technology can continue to deliver consistent drug dosing even if it is heavily covered in fibrotic scar tissue. The technology may pave the way for fully autonomous implants that can monitor their environment and make adjustments as required to achieve their goals.</p> <p>&;This is a new area of research that can have implications in other places and is not solely limited for the treatment of diabetes,” said Garry Duffy, a researcher involved in the study. “Our discovery could provide consistent and responsive dosing over long periods, without clinician involvement, enhancing efficacy and reducing the need for device replacement because of fibrosis.&;</p> <p>Study in journal <em>Science Robotics</em>: <a href="" https://www. science.org/doi/10.1126/scirob otics.abq4821 "">Soft robot–mediated autonomous adaptation to fibrotic capsule formation for improved drug delivery</a></p> <p>Via: <a href="" https://www. universityofgalway.ie/about-us /news-and-events/news-archive/2023/august/ai-enabled-soft-robotic-implant-monitors-scar-tissue-to-self-adapt-for-personalised-drug-treatment.html "">University of Galway</a> </p> <!--TrendMD v2.4.8--> .

Saliva collection often acts as a less invasive alternative than throat swabs in the detection of a variety of pathogens, such as that causing streptococcal soar throat (strep throat). However, manually collecting the right amount of saliva is pretty gross. In an effort to streamline this process, and make it more appealing to both adults and children, these researchers have developed a new solution. The CandyCollect is a specially designed lollipop that collects saliva as someone sucks it. It contains a series of grooves that collect saliva, and bacteria within the saliva tend to adhere to the channel walls, for later collection and analysis.</p> <p>Pathogenic illnesses in the mouth and throat may require some sample collection and analysis before clinicians can decide on the best course of treatment. Typically, such samples are analyzed using techniques such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction. This could be used to detect which bacteria are causing an infection, for example. Throat swabs are one option to collect such samples, but they can induce gagging and are a little invasive, particularly for nervous patients such as children.</p> <p>Saliva collection can work as a non-invasive alternative, but this approach requires a surprising amount of saliva to work, which is a little gross to collect. It can also be difficult for children to perform this procedure. In an effort to develop an effective and fun alternative, these researchers have turned to candy.

Health,MentalHealth,". TITLE:  Proposed Pennsylvania Bill Sparks Discussion on Psychologist Prescription Authority—House Bill 1000 Thank you Dr. Pope -------- Forwarded Message -------- The Franklin County Free Press includes an article: “Proposed Pennsylvania Bill Sparks Discussion on Psychologist Prescription Authority.” Here are some excerpts: A new proposal, House Bill 1000, aims to expand healthcare accessibility in Pennsylvania by allowing psychologists to gain prescription authority, a privilege similar to primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants for psychotropic medications. The bill sets forth educational and training criteria established by the state Board of Psychology for psychologists to qualify for prescription privileges. Currently, a handful of states, along with federal entities such as the U.S. military, the Public Health Service, and the Indian Health Service, already grant psychologists the authority to prescribe medication. Proponents of HB1000 argue that this legislation offers a viable solution to the issue of limited access to psychotropic medications. They highlight that a national study indicated that only 18% of psychiatrists were accepting new patients, leading to substantial wait times for mental health care. Advocates contend that states where psychologists can prescribe medicine have witnessed a decline in mental health-related mortality rates and have not experienced significant safety concerns or overprescription problems. Furthermore, these states saw increased accessibility for rural patients and those on Medicaid. Opponents of the bill, including the state psychiatry association, express reservations about the proposal. They raise concerns about the potential impact of limiting psychologists’ training and expertise to a specific aspect of healthcare. Critics emphasize the comprehensive nature of medical education and training, distinguishing it from the training psychologists receive. <snip> It is important to note that previous attempts to expand healthcare access in Pennsylvania have faced challenges. The state’s history of licensing issues and the struggle to establish a nurse licensing compact with other states underscore the complexities involved in healthcare reform.

Environment,RenewableEnergy,"As a reminder,  is Europe’s self-nominated leader in energy transformation  ,  and climate change mitigation… These claims are based on the fact that it has the largest installed capacity in renewables (true) - 66 GW and 69 GW in wind and solar, respectively. Plus 38 GW in coal and 32 GW in gas for when, you know, the former don’t work. Yet, right now Germany’s CO2 intensity is very high: 564 gCO₂eq/kWh . While the renewables are running at rather miserable <10% of the installed capacity, the country effectively runs on coal and gas. So, just to reiterate: Germany has installed power triple redundant to its consumption: ~60 GW in fossil fuels, ~60 GW in wind and ~60 GW in solar. Every single GW of each is thousands of tons of steel, concrete and other resources that had to be mined, processed and installed, occupying land surface. And each of them works only small part of the time, which is an enormous waste of resources and energy.  and  help a bit exporting some low-carbon  energy to Germany, but that’s only ~5%.

It didn't have much equipment other than some ""steps"" and a chin up bar. A third item had the useful parts missing. Not the best area, Bentley! So I just rode aimlessly for a while, exploring the surrounding area, helping myself to some ripe mulberries from someone's front yard tree, before taking a scenic route home.

Travel,OutdoorAdventures,"Just got back from a 17km bicycle ride. I'm on a mission to check out all the outdoor gyms in my area, in order of distance, according to https:// freeoutdoorfitness.net/ - I'd love to know how to make an account and review the locations, since info provided is minimal, but they seem to only have a login option, no registration 😒 Today was my second attempt to reach this one; a flat tyre screwed up the last try, also happens to be the second location on my list. On the way I saw lots of ducks, stopped to take a photo of a cute little duck family. In another spot I laughed at a duck who tried to attack me while I cruised past. I'm sure it was satisfied that it scared me away effectively. When I reached my destination I spent 15 mins or so using the equipment, enjoyed the view and set off home again. My best 1km time was 2:36 (22.9km/h) All in all, a good trip! 🙂 # bicycling # fitness # OutdoorAdventures",#bicycling,#fitness,,,,Egoplacebo,2023-09-23 07:05:41+00:00

Education,OnlineLearning,"This is a great series of brief interviews between Tim Fawns and an assortment of educators and researchers from across the world on the subject of generative AI and its impact on learning and teaching. The latest (tenth in the series) is with me. Tim asked us all to come up with 3 key statements beforehand that he used to structure the interviews. I only realized that I had to do this on the day of the interview so mine are not very well thought-through, but there follows a summary of very roughly what I would have said about each if my wits were sharper. The reality was, of course, not quite like this. I meandered around a few other ideas and we ran out of time, but I think this captures the gist of what I actually wanted to convey: Key statement 1: Most academics are afraid of AIs being used by students to cheat. I am afraid of AIs being used by teachers to cheat. For much the same reasons that many of us balk at students using, say, ChatGPT to write part or all of their essays or code, I think we should be concerned when teachers use it to replace or supplement their teaching, whether it be for writing course outlines, assessing student work, or acting as intelligent tutors (to name but a few common uses).  The main thing that bothers me is that human teachers (including other learners, authors, and many more) do not simply help learners to achieve specified learning outcomes. In the process, they model ways of thinking, values, attitudes, feelings, and a host of other hard-to-measure tacit and implicit phenomena that relate to ways of being, ways of interacting, ways of responding, and ways of connecting with others. There can be huge value in seeing the world through another’s eyes, of interacting with them, adapting your responses, seeing how they adapt to yours, and so on. This is a critical part of how we learn the soft stuff, the ways of doing things, the meaning, the social value, the connections with our own motivations, and so on. In short, education is as much about being a human being, living in human communities, as it is about learning facts and skills. Even when we are not interacting but, say, simply reading a book, we are learning not just the contents but the ways the contents are presented, the quirks, the passions, the ways the authors think of their readers, their implicit beliefs, and so on. While a generative AI can mimic this pretty well, it is by nature a kind of average, a blurry reconstruction mashed up from countless examples of the work of real humans. It is human-like, not human. It can mimic a wide assortment of nearly-humans without identity, without purpose, without persistence, without skin in the game. As things currently stand (though this will change) it is also likely to be pretty bland – good enough, but not great. It might be argued that this is better than nothing at all, or that it augments rather than replaces human teachers, or it helps with relatively mundance chores, or it provides personalized support and efficiencies in learning hard skills, or it allows teachers to focus on those human aspects, or even that using a generative AI is a good way of learning in itself . Right now and in the near future, this may be true because we are in a system on the verge of disruption, not yet in the thick of it, and we come to it with all our existing skills and structures intact. My concern is what happens as it scales and becomes ubiquitous; as the bean-counting focus on efficiencies that relate solely to measurable outcomes increasingly crowd out the time spent with other humans; as the generative AIs feed on one another becoming more and more divorced from their human originals; as the skills of teaching that are replaced by AIs atrophy in the next generation; as time we spend with one another is replaced with time spent with not-quite human simulacra; as the AIs themselves become more and more a part of our cognitive apparatus in both what is learned and how we learn it. There are Monkeys’ Paws all the way down the line: for everything that might improved, there are at least as many things that can and will get worse. Key statement 2: We and our technologies are inherently intertwingled so it makes no more sense to exclude AIs from the classroom than it would to exclude, say, books or writing. The big questions are about what we need to keep. Our cognition is fundamentally intertwingled with the technologies that we use, both physical and cognitive, and those technologies are intertwingled with one another, and that’s how our collective intelligence emerges. For all the vital human aspects mentioned above, a significant part of the educational process is concerned with building cognitive gadgets that enable us to participate in the technologies of our cultures, from poetry and long division to power stations and web design. Through that participation our cognition is highly distributed, and our intelligence is fundamentally collective. Now that generative AIs are part of that, it would be crazy to exclude them from classrooms or from their use in assessments. It does, however, raise more than a few questions about what cognitive activities we still need to keep for ourselves. Technologies expand or augment what we can do unaided. Writing, say, allows us (among other things) to extend our memories. This creates many adjacent possibles , including sharing them with others, and allowing us to construct more complex ideas using scaffolding that would be very difficult to construct on our own because our memories are not that great. Central to the nature of writing is that, as with most technologies, we don’t just use it but we participate in its enactment, performing part of the orchestration ourselves (for instance we choose what words and ideas we write – the soft stuff), but also being part of its orchestration (e.g we must typically spell words and use grammar sufficiently uniformly that others can understand them – the hard stuff). In the past, we used to do nearly all of that writing by hand. Handwriting was a hard skill that had to be learned well enough that others could read what we have written, a process that typically required years of training and practice, demanding mastery of a wide range of technical proficiencies from spelling and punctuation to manual dexterity and the ability to sharpen a quill/fill a fountain pen/insert a cartridge, etc. To an increasingly large extent we have now offloaded many of those hard skills, first to typewriters and now to computers. While some of the soft aspects of handwriting have been lost – the cognitive processes that affect how we write and how we think, the expressiveness of the never-perfect ways we write letters on a page, etc – this was a sensible thing to do. From a functional perspective, text produced by a computer is far more consistent, far more readable, far more adaptable, far more reusable, and far more easily communicated. Why should we devote so much effort and time to learning to be part of a machine when a machine can do that part for us, and do it better? Something that can free us from having to act as an inflexible machine seems, by and large, like a good thing. If we don’t have to do it ourselves then we can spend more time and effort on what we do, how we do it, the soft stuff, the creative stuff, the problem-solving stuff, and so on. It allows us to be more capable, to reach further, to communicate more clearly. There are some really big issues relating to the ways that the constraints of handwriting such as the relative difficulty of making corrections, the physicality of the movements, and the ways our brains are changed by handwriting that result in different ways of thinking, some of which may be very valuable. But, as Postman wrote , all technologies are Faustian bargains involving losses and harms as well as gains and benefits. A technology that thrives is usually (at least in the short term) one in which the gains are perceived to outweigh the losses. And, even when largely replaced, old technologies seldom if ever die , so it is usually possible to retrieve what is lost, at least until the skills atrophy, components are no longer made, or they are designed to die (old printers with chip-protected cartridges that are no longer made, for instance). What is fundamentally different about generative AIs, however, is that they allow us to offload exactly the soft, creative, problem solving aspects of our cognition, that technologies normally support and expand, to a machine. They provide extremely good pastiches of human thought and creativity that can act well enough to be considered as drop-in replacements. In many cases, they can do so a lot better – from the point of view of someone seeing only the outputs – than an average human. An AI image generator can draw a great deal better than me, for instance. But, given that these machines are now part of our extended, intertwingled minds, what is left for us? What parts of our minds should they or will they replace? How can we use them without losing the capacity to do at least some of the things they do better or as well as us? What happens if we lack those cognitive gadgets we never installed in our minds because AIs did it for us? This is not the same as, say, not knowing how to make a bow and arrow or write in cuneiform. Even when atrophied, such skills can be recovered. This is the stuff that we learn the other stuff for . It is especially important in the field of education which, traditionally at least, has been deeply concerned with cultivating the hard skills largely if not solely so that we can use them creatively, socially and productively once they are learned. If the machines are doing that for us, what is our role? This is not (yet) Kurzweil’s singularity , the moment when machines exceed our own intelligence and start to develop on their own, but it is the (drawn-out, fragmented) moment that machines have become capable of participating in soft, creative technologies on at least equal footing to humans. That matters. This leads to my final key statement. Key statement 3: AIs create countless new adjacent possible empty niches. They can augment what we can do, but we need to go full-on Amish when deciding whether they should replace what we already do. Every new creation in the world opens up new and inherently unprestatable adjacent possible empty niches for further creation, not just in how it can be used as part of new assemblies but in how it connects with those that already exist. It’s the exponential dynamic ratchet underlying natural evolution as much as technology, and it is what results in the complexity of the universe. The rapid acceleration in use and complexity of generative AIs – itself enabled by the adjacent possibles of the already highly disruptive Internet – that we have seen over the past couple of years has resulted in a positive explosion of new adjacent possibles, in turn spawning others, and so on, at a hitherto unprecedented scale and speed. This is exactly what we should expect in an exponentially growing system. It makes it increasingly difficult to predict what will happen next, or what skills, attitudes, and values we will need to deal with it, or how we will affected by it. As the number of possible scenarios increases at the same exponential rate, and the time between major changes gets ever shorter, patterns of thinking, ways of doing things, skills we need, and the very structures of our societies must change in unpredictable ways, too. Occupations, including in education, are already being massively disrupted, for better and for worse. Deeply embedded systems, from assessment for credentials to the mass media, are suddenly and catastrophically breaking.  Legislation, regulations, resistance from groups of affected individuals, and other checks and balances may slightly alter the rate of change, but likely not enough to matter. Education serves both a stabilizing and a generative role in society, but educators are at least as unprepared and at least as disrupted as anyone else. We don’t – in fact we cannot – know what kind of world we are preparing our students for, and the generative technologies that now form part of our cognition are changing faster than we can follow. Any AI literacies we develop will be obsolete in the blink of an eye. And, remember, generative AIs are not just replacing hard skills. They are replacing the soft ones, the things that we use our hard skills to accomplish. This is why I believe we would do well to heed the example of the Amish, who (contrary to popular belief) are not opposed to modern technologies but, in their communities, debate and discuss the merits and disadvantages of any technology that is available, considering the ways in which it might affect or conflict with their values, only adopting those agreed to be, on balance, good, and only doing so in ways that accord with those values. Different communities make different choices according to their contexts and needs. In order to do that, we have to have values in the first place. But what are the values that matter in education? With a few exceptions (laws and regulations being the main ones) technologies do not determine how we will act but, through the ways they integrate with our shared cognition, existing technologies, and practices, they have a lot of momentum and, unchecked, generative AIs will inherit the values associated with what currently exists. In educational systems that are increasingly regulated by government mandates that focus on nothing but their economic contributions to industry, where success or failure is measured solely by proxy criteria like predetermined outcomes of learning and enrolments, where a millennium of path dependencies still embodies patterns of teacher control and indoctrination that worked for mediaeval monks and skillsets that suited the demands of factory owners during the industrial revolution, this will not end well. Now seems the time we most need to reassert and double down on the human, the social, the cultural, the societal, the personal, and the tacit value of our institutions. This is the time to talk about those values, locally and globally. This is the time to examine what matters, what we care about, what we must not lose, and why we must not lose it. Tomorrow it will be too late. I think this is a time of great risk but it is also a time of great opportunity, a chance to reflect on and examine the value and nature of education itself. Some of us have been wanting to have these conversations for decades.

Education,OnlineLearning,"Research, Writing, and Creative Process in Open and Distance Education: Tales from the Field is a great new book about how researchers in the field of open, online, and distance education go about writing and/or their advice to newcomers in the field. More than that, it is about the process of writing in general, containing stories, recommendations, methods, tricks, and principles that pretty much anyone who writes, from students to experienced authors, would find useful and interesting. It is published as an open book (with a very open CC-BY-NC licence) that is free to read or download as well as to purchase in paper form. OK, full disclosure, I am a bit biased. I have a chapter in it, and many of the rest are by friends and aquaintances. The editor and author of one of the chapters is Dianne Conrad, the foreword is by Terry Anderson, and the list of authors includes some of the most luminous, widely cited names in the field, with a wealth of experience and many thousands of publications between them. The full list includes David Starr-Glass, Pamela Ryan,  Junhong Xiao, Jennifer Roberts, Aras Bozkurt, Catherine Cronin, Randy Garrison, Tony Bates, Mark Nichols, Marguerite Koole (with Michael Cottrell, Janet Okoko & Kristine Dreaver-Charles), and Paul Prinsloo. Apart from being a really good idea that fills a really important gap in the market, what I love most about the book is the diversity of the chapters. There’s everything from practical advice on how to structure an effective paper, to meandering reflective streams of consciousness that read like poetry, to academic discussions of identity and culture. It contains a lot of great stories that present a rich variety of approaches and processes, offering far from uniform suggestions about how best to write or why it is worth doing in the first place. Though the contributors are all researchers in the field of open and distance learning, nearly all of us started out on very different career paths, so we come at it with a wide range of disciplinary, epistemological and stylistic frameworks. Dianne has done a great job of weaving all of these different perspectives together into a coherent tapestry, not just a simple collection of essays. The diversity is also a direct result of the instructions Dianne sent with the original proposal, which provides a pretty good description of the general approach and content that you will find in the book: I am asking colleagues, as researchers, scholars, teachers, and writers in our field (ODL), to reflect on and write about your research/writing process, including topics such as: *   Your background and training as a scholar *   Your scholarly interests *   Why you research/write *   How you research/write *   What philosophies guide your work? *   Conflicts?  Barriers? *   Mentors, opportunities *   Reflections, insights, sorrows *   Advice, takeaways *   Anything else you feel is relevant The “personal stuff,” as listed above, should serve as jump-off points to scholarly issues; that is, this isn’t intended to be a memoir or even a full-on reflective. Use the opportunity to reflect on your own work as a lead-in/up to the scholarly issues you want to address/promote/explore. The aim of the book is to inform hesitant scholars, new scholars, and fledgling/nervous writers of our time-tested processes; and to spread awareness of the behind-the-curtain work involved in publishing and “being heard.” My own chapter ( Chapter 3, On being written ) starts with rather a lot of sailing metaphors that tack around the ways that writing participates in my cognition and connects us, moves back to the land with a slight clunk and some geeky practical advice about my approach to notetaking and the roles of the tools that I use for the purpose, thence saunters on to the value of academic blogging and how I feel about it, and finally to a conclusion that frames the rest in something akin to a broader theory of complexity and cognition. All of it draws heavily from themes and theories explored in my recently published (also open) book, How Education Works: Teaching, Technology, and Technique . For all the stretched metaphors, meandering sidetracks, and clunky continuity I’m quite pleased with how it came out. Most of the other chapters are better structured and organized, and most have more direct advice on the process (from start to finish), but they all tell rich, personal, and enlightening stories that are fascinating to read, especially if you know the people writing them or are familiar with their work. However, while the context, framing, and some of the advice is specific to the field of open and distance learning, the vast majority of lessons and advice are about academic writing in general. Whatever field you identify with, if you ever have to write anything then there’s probably something in it for you.

Lifestyle,PersonalDevelopment,"To be able to ""teach"" you must know how to lead. Leaders lead by actions and examples. Leading is a long process. So actions must be consistent. Actions are consistent only when they are real. Actions are real when they are truly meant. They are real when they are an image of your inner self, your character and your personality. So, first you need to ""teach yourself"" before ""teaching others"". # leadership # leader # personalgrowth # personaldevelopment # teamempowerment",#leadership,#leader,#personalgrowth,#personaldevelopment,#teamempowerment,Ivan,2023-09-10 11:40:56+00:00
